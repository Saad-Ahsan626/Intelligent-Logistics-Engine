Intelligent Logistics Engine (SwiftEx) 📦 🚚Course: Data Structures & Algorithms (CSC-200L)Institution: University of Engineering and Technology (UET), LahoreA comprehensive C++ console application designed to simulate a modern courier logistics system. This project integrates robust data structures to handle intelligent parcel sorting, optimal route calculation, real-time tracking, and rider management. It features a CLI interface coupled with a live web-based visualization dashboard.🚀 FeaturesCore OperationsRole-Based Access: Secure Login and Registration system for Admins and Customers.Smart Dispatching: Creates parcel requests with specific weights and priorities (Standard, Express, Urgent).Intelligent Routing: Calculates all available paths between cities using DFS and recommends the shortest route based on distance.Priority Sorting: Automatically processes high-priority and urgent parcels first using a Max-Heap.Live Tracking: Provides a detailed timeline of events (Pickup -> Warehouse -> In Transit -> Delivered) for every parcel.Advanced CapabilitiesWeb Visualization: Launches a local Python HTTP server to display a live, graphical map of cities, roads, and moving parcels in your browser (monitor.html).Dynamic Traffic: Simulates random road blockages, forcing the system to re-route parcels in real-time.Undo System: Allows admins to revert recent actions (like creating or dispatching a parcel) using a Stack.Investigation Protocol: Handles missing parcels with an automated investigation simulation and insurance claim generation.Graph Management: Admins can add new cities, build roads, or block existing routes dynamically.🧠 Data Structures UsedThis project is built using custom implementations of the following data structures:ComponentData StructurePurposeMap NetworkGraph (Adjacency Lists)Manages city connections, distances, and road statuses.Parcel SortingMax-Heap (Priority Queue)Sorts parcels by priorityScore to ensure urgent deliveries go first.DatabaseHash TableProvides $O(1)$ access for Parcel IDs and User credentials using Quadratic Probing.Transit SystemLinked ListManages the lifecycle of parcels currently "In Transit" or "Loading".Rider FleetQueueManages rider availability in a round-robin fashion.Undo LogStackStores recent operations to allow for "Undo" functionality.StorageCustom ArrayListsefficient dynamic arrays for edges, paths, and object lists.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: C++ (Standard 11+)Frontend: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript (for monitor.html).Server: Python http.server (automates hosting the visualization).OS: Windows (optimized for windows.h console features).⚙️ Installation & RunPrerequisitesC++ Compiler (MinGW, g++, or Visual Studio).Python installed (required for the web monitor).StepsClone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/logistics-engine.git
